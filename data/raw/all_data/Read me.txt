3 specimens.
n = not thermally cycled
c1= thermally cycled once

Magnifications at 200x (full) and magnifications at 500x. 
Those at 500x must be stitched manually. 
There are more copies in case of image defects (some areas may not be in focus)
Some photos (-copies) have marks on where I split the photos.
